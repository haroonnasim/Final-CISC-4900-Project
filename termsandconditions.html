                    I. GENERAL TERMS.
                    <br />
                    These Terms of Service and Additional Terms and Conditions (“Agreement”) set forth the terms and conditions that apply to your access and use of the budgetapp.com, mobile App, and additional services that may be offered as owned and operated by Budget App., its subsidiaries and/or affiliates (“Budget App”). As used in this Agreement, the term "Site" includes all Budget App Services websites, pages that are associated with or within each website and all devices, applications or services that Budget App operates or offers that link to this Agreement. By accepting electronically (for example, clicking “I Agree”), installing, accessing or using the Services, you agree to be bound by the terms and conditions of this Agreement and Budget App Privacy and Security Policy, as they may be amended from time to time in the future (see “Modifications” below). If you do not agree to this Agreement, then you may not use
                    the Services.
                    <br /> <br />
                    1. Accepting the Terms
                    <br />
                    By using the information, tools, features, software and functionality including content, updates and new releases provided by Budget App of the Budget App Services, you agree to be bound by this Agreement, whether you are a “Visitor” (which means that you simply browse the Budgetapp.com website), or a “Customer” (which means that you have registered for an account with us to use any one of our Services.) The term “you” or “User” refers to a Visitor, Member or Customer. The term “we” refers to Budget App. If you wish to become a Customer or want to make use of the Services, you must read this Agreement and indicate your acceptance during the registration process.
                    You may not use any of the Services and you may not accept this Agreement if you are not legally authorized to accept and be bound by these terms or are not at least 18 years of age and, in any event, of a legal age to form a binding contract with Budget App.
                    Before you continue, you should print or save a local copy of this Agreement for your records.
                    <br /> <br />
                    2. Privacy and your Personal Information
                    <br />
                    You can view the Budget App Privacy Statement here and on the Site for the Services. You agree to the applicable Budget App Privacy Statement, and any changes published by Budget App. You agree that Budget App may use and maintain your data according to the Budget App’s Privacy Statement, as part of the Services. You give Budget App permission to combine information you enter or upload for the Services with that of other users of the Services and/or other Budget App services. For example, this means that Budget App may use your and other users’ non-identifiable, aggregated data to improve the Services or to design promotions. Budget App may access or store personal information in multiple countries, including countries outside of your own country to the extent permitted by applicable law.
                    <br />
                    California Consumer Privacy Act. For the purposes of the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), Budget App shall be considered a Business and/or Third Party, as applicable. Where Budget App acts as a Third Party, you represent, warrant and covenant that all Personal Information provided or otherwise made available to Budget App is done so in compliance with applicable law, and that you have provided all necessary and appropriate notices and opt-outs, and otherwise have all necessary and appropriate rights, to enable Budget App to (i) share any and all Personal Information you provided with any Budget App company, including Budget App Inc. and any parent, subsidiary, affiliate, or related company of Budget App Inc. (collectively, the “Budget App Family Companies”), and (ii) use any such Personal Information in connection with any and all Budget App Family Companies’ internal operations and functions, including, but not limited to, improving such Budget App Family Companies’ products and/or services, operational analytics and reporting, internal financial reporting and analysis, audit functions and archival purposes. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties agree that the sharing of Personal Information between Budget App Family Companies does not constitute a “sale” of such Personal Information under the CCPA. Capitalized terms in this paragraph have the meanings given those terms under the CCPA.
                    <br /> <br />
                    3. Description of the Services
                    <br />
                    The Budget App Service is a personal finance information management service that allows you to consolidate and track your financial information. The Budget App Service is provided to you by Budget App without charge (it is free) and is meant to provide you with your information to allow you to organize and manage your finances.
                    The Budget App Service also includes your one-bureau credit summary, credit score and monitoring alerts (“Credit Score Services”) which is described below.
                    The Services may also present you information relating to third party products or services (“Budget App Offers”) that you may be interested in as well as provide you general tips, recommendations and educational material.
                    <br /> <br />
                    4. Account Information from Third Party Sites
                    <br />
                    Users may direct Budget App to retrieve their own information maintained online by third-parties with which they have customer relationships, maintain accounts or engage in financial transactions (“Account Information”). Budget App works with one or more online service providers to access this Account Information. Budget App does not review the Account Information for accuracy, legality or non-infringement. Budget App is not responsible for the Account Information or products and services offered by or on third-party sites.
                    Budget App cannot always foresee or anticipate technical or other difficulties which may result in failure to obtain data or loss of data, personalization settings or other service interruptions. Budget App cannot assume responsibility for the timeliness, accuracy, deletion, non-delivery or failure to store any user data, communications or personalization settings. For example, when displayed through the Services, Account Information is only as fresh as the time shown, which reflects when the information is obtained from such sites. Such information may be more up-to-date when obtained directly from the relevant sites. You can refresh your Account Information through the Services, in the manner prescribed in the associated instructions.
                    <br /> <br />
                    5. Budget App Offers and Third-Party Links
                    <br />
                    The Services may include sponsored links from advertisers. The Services may display Budget App Offers that may be custom matched to you based on information stored in the Services, queries made through the Services or other information. We may disclose when a particular Budget App Offer is sponsored or otherwise provided by a third party.
                    In connection with Budget App Offers, the Services will provide links to other web sites belonging to Budget App advertisers and other third parties. Budget App Offers are provided to you as a convenience. Budget App does not endorse, warrant or guarantee the products or services available through the Budget App Offers (or any other third-party products or services advertised on or linked from our site), whether or not sponsored. Budget App is not an agent or broker or otherwise responsible for the activities or policies of those web sites. Budget App does not guarantee that the loan, investment, plan or other service terms, rates or rewards offered by any particular advertiser or other third party on the Sites are actually the terms that may be offered to you if you pursue the offer or that they are the best terms or lowest rates available in the market. Information in the Budget App Offers are provided by the third parties, and any offer is subject to the third parties’ review of your information. Budget App may receive compensation from third parties which may impact the placement and availability of the Budget App Offers.
                    If you elect to use or purchase services from third parties, you are subject to their terms and conditions and
                    privacy policy.
                    <br /> <br />
                    6. Your Registration Information and Electronic Communications

These inquiries may include asking you for further information, requiring you to provide your full address, your date of birth, your social security number and/or requiring you to take steps to confirm ownership of your email address or financial instruments, ordering a credit report, or verifying information you provide against third party databases or through other sources. If you do not provide this information or Budget App cannot verify your identity, we can refuse to allow you to use the Services.
                    You agree and understand that you are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your password which, together with your LoginID, allows you to access the Sites. That LoginID and password, together with any mobile number or other information you provide form your “Registration Information.” By providing us with your e-mail address, you consent to receive all required notices and information. Electronic communications may be posted on the Services site and/or delivered to your e-mail address that we have on file for you. It is your responsibility to promptly update us with your complete, accurate contact information, or change your information, including email address, as appropriate. Notices will be provided in HTML (or, if your system does not support HTML, in plain-text) in the text of the e-mail or through a link to the appropriate page on our site, accessible through any standard, commercially available internet browser. Your consent to receive communications electronically is valid until you end your relationship with us.
                    You may print a copy of any electronic communications and retain it for your records. We reserve the right to terminate or change how we provide electronic communications and will provide you with appropriate notice in accordance with applicable law.
                    If you become aware of any unauthorized use of your Registration or Account Information for the Services, you agree to notify Budget App immediately at the email address - security@Budget App.com.
                    If you believe that your Registration or Account Information or device that you use to access the Services has been lost or stolen, or that someone is using your account without your permission, you must notify us immediately in order to minimize your possible losses.
                    <br /> <br />
                    7. Your Use of the Services
                    <br />
                    Your right to access and use the Sites and the Services is personal to you and is not transferable by you to any other person or entity. You are only entitled to access and use the Sites and Services for lawful purposes. Accurate records enable Budget App to provide the Services to you. You must provide true, accurate, current and complete information about your accounts maintained at other web sites, as requested in our “add account” setup forms, and you may not misrepresent your Registration and Account Information. In order for the Services to function effectively, you must also keep your Registration and Account Information up to date and accurate. If you do not do this, the accuracy and effectiveness of the Services will be affected. You represent that you are a legal owner of, and that you are authorized to provide us with, all Registration and Account Information and other information necessary to facilitate your use of
                    the Services.
                    Your access and use of the Services may be interrupted from time to time for any of several reasons, including, without limitation, the malfunction of equipment, periodic updating, maintenance or repair of the Services or other actions that Budget App, in its sole discretion, may elect to take. In no event will Budget App be liable to any party for any loss, cost, or damage that results from any scheduled or unscheduled downtime.
                    Your sole and exclusive remedy for any failure or non-performance of the Services, including any associated software or other materials supplied in connection with such services, will be for Budget App to use commercially reasonable efforts to effectuate an adjustment or repair of the applicable service.
                    From time to time, Budget App may include new and/or updated pre-release features and trial use (“Sneak Preview” features) in Services for your use and which permit you to provide feedback. You understand and agree that your use of Sneak Preview features is voluntary and Budget App is not obligated to provide you with any Sneak Preview features. Furthermore, if you decide to use the Sneak Preview features you agree to abide by any rules or restrictions Budget App may place on them. You understand that once you use the Sneak Preview features, you may be unable to revert back to the earlier version of the same or similar feature. Additionally, if such reversion is possible, you may not be able to return or restore data created within the Sneak Preview feature back to the earlier version. The Sneak Preview features are provided on an “as is” basis and may contain errors or inaccuracies that could cause failures, corruption or loss of data and/or information from any connected device. You acknowledge and agree that all use of the Sneak Preview features is at your sole risk.
                    <br /> <br />
                    8. Use With Your Mobile Device
                    <br />
                    Use of these Services may be available through a compatible mobile device, Internet and/or network access and may require software. You agree that you are solely responsible for these requirements, including any applicable changes, updates and fees as well as the terms of your agreement with your mobile device and telecommunications provider. BUDGET APP MAKES NO WARRANTIES OR REPRESENTATIONS OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS, STATUTORY OR IMPLIED AS TO: 
                    <br />
                    (i) THE AVAILABILITY OF TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES FROM YOUR PROVIDER AND ACCESS TO THE SERVICES AT ANY TIME OR FROM ANY LOCATION; 
                    <br />
                    (ii) ANY LOSS, DAMAGE, OR OTHER SECURITY INTRUSION OF THE TELECOMMUNICATION SERVICES; AND 
                    <br />
                    (iii) ANY DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES OR FAILURE TO TRANSMIT ANY DATA, COMMUNICATIONS OR SETTINGS CONNECTED WITH THE SERVICES.
                    <br /> <br />
                    9. Online and Mobile Alerts
                    <br />
                    Budget App may from time to time provide automatic alerts and voluntary account-related alerts. Automatic alerts may be sent to you following certain changes to your account or information, such as a change in your
                    Registration Information.
                    Voluntary account alerts may be turned on by default as part of the Services. They may then be customized, deactivated or reactivated by you. These alerts allow you to choose alert messages for your accounts. Budget App may add new alerts from time to time, or cease to provide certain alerts at any time upon its sole discretion. Each alert has different options available, and you may be asked to select from among these options upon activation of your alerts service.
                    You understand and agree that any alerts provided to you through the Services may be delayed or prevented by a variety of factors. Budget App may make commercially reasonable efforts to provide alerts in a timely manner with accurate information, but cannot guarantee the delivery, timeliness, or accuracy of the content of any alert. Budget App will not be liable for any delays, failure to deliver, or misdirected delivery of any alert; for any errors in the content of an alert; or for any actions taken or not taken by you or any third party in reliance on an alert.
                    Electronic alerts will be sent to the email address or mobile number you have provided for the Services. If your email address or your mobile number changes, you are responsible for informing us of that change. Alerts may also be sent to a mobile device that accepts text messages. Changes to your email address and mobile number will apply to all of your alerts.
                    Because alerts are not encrypted, we will never include your passcode. However, alerts may include your Login ID and some information about your accounts. Depending upon which alerts you select, information such as an account balance or the due date for your credit card payment may be included. Anyone with access to your email will be able to view the content of these alerts. At any time you may disable future alerts.
                    <br /> <br />
